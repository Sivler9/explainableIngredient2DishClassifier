# ShapBackprop for food classification

This repository contains the project for my Master's Thesis.

## Environment

The software has been developed and trained using python 3.9 venv in Ubuntu 21.04, installing the following libraries (and their dependencies) in venv:

    matplotlib~=3.5.1
    numpy~=1.21.5
    pandas~=1.4.0
    Pillow~=9.0.0
    shap~=0.40.0
    torch~=1.10.1
    torchvision~=0.11.2
    tqdm~=4.62.3
    albumentations~=1.1.0

## Steps to reproduce

 * `git clone https://github.com/Sivler9/explainableIngredient2DishClassifier`
 * `cd explainableIngredient2DishClassifier`

 * Download datasets to Data/

 * `python train.py`

## Results

Since execution is slow, you can see the results [hear](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e9pkdsRq0UaWCjKrTdVc5469SAoXxcyx?usp=sharing).
